## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
Many people who work in software development today have heard of the practice of pair programming, yet it still only has patchy adoption in the industry. One reason for its varying acceptance is that its benefits are not immediately obvious, it pays off more in the medium- and long-term.

## How I explained REST to my brother
1. He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internetâ€¦ and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

2. That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.

3. Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET
4. he POST request method requests that a web server accepts the data enclosed in the body of the request message, most likely for storing it

5. The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like
