1. Is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
2. they are immediately testable. They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments. They also makes maintaining and refactoring code much easier.
3. One of the major benefits of using pure functions is they are immediately testable. They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments. They also makes maintaining and refactoring code much easier.

4. In JavaScript, only objects and arrays are mutable, not primitive values. … A mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created. Immutables are the objects whose state cannot be changed once the object is created. Strings and Numbers are Immutable
5. Referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs. An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior

6. Modules are small-ish certain packages of code and js files that we can use to do specific things, we use them so we don't have to download a metric ton of code every time, and instead, just get this comparatively small number of files.
7. function is the easiest way to include modules that exist in separate files. 

8. by require statement
9. module.export
