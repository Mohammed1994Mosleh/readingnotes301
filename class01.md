# Introduction to React and Components.
## defenetion :
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

Component-based architecture focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties.

Component-oriented software design has many advantages over the traditional object-oriented approaches such as:
1. Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.
2. Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.

## Characteristics of Components:
1. Reusability .
2. Replaceable.
3. Not context specific .
4. Extensible.
5. Encapsulated .
6. Independent .

## Advantages
* Ease of deployment.
* Reduced cost.
* Ease of development.
* Reusable.
* Modification of technical complexity.
* Reliability.
* System maintenance and evolution.
* Independent.

## Props & React.
Props is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

* props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.

### properites:
* Props stand for properties and is a special keyword in React
* Props are being passed to components like function arguments
* Props can only be passed to components in one-way (parent to child)
* Props data is immutable (read-only)
